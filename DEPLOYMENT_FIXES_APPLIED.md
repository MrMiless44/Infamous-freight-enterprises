# 🔧 DEPLOYMENT FIXES APPLIED - December 13, 2025

## Summary

Two critical Docker build issues have been identified and fixed:

### 1. **Prisma Schema Missing Error** ✅

**Problem**: Error "Could not find Prisma Schema that is required for this command"

- The Dockerfile wasn't including the Prisma schema in the final Docker stage
- This caused Prisma Client generation to fail at runtime

**Solution Applied** (Commit: d2b7a3a):

```dockerfile
# Added this line to ensure Prisma schema is available in production
COPY api/prisma ./api/prisma
```

- Also improved the HEALTHCHECK to use Node.js http module instead of wget
- Increased start-period from 20s to 30s for better initialization

### 2. **pnpm-lock.yaml Out of Sync** ✅

**Problem**: Error "Cannot install with frozen-lockfile because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date"

- API package.json was changed from `"@infamous-freight/shared": "workspace:*"` to `"file:../packages/shared"`
- But pnpm-lock.yaml still referenced the old workspace protocol
- Docker build failed during `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`

**Solution Applied** (Commit: 4c2ca3e):

```bash
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

- Regenerated pnpm-lock.yaml with correct file path dependencies
- Committed updated lock file to ensure consistency across all builds

## Files Modified

1. **api/Dockerfile**
   - Added `COPY api/prisma ./api/prisma` to include schema
   - Improved HEALTHCHECK (Node.js http instead of wget)
   - Increased start-period to 30s

2. **pnpm-lock.yaml**
   - Regenerated with correct file path dependencies
   - Ensures Docker builds work with frozen-lockfile

## Deployment Status

- ✅ New Docker image deployed to Fly.io (deployment-01KCC9N96HQG0RZKW2N5DPGKV3)
- ✅ Machines restarted with fixed image
- ⏳ Machines initializing with new build
- ⏳ Testing API health endpoint

## Next Steps

1. Wait for machines to fully initialize (2-3 minutes)
2. Test API health endpoint: `curl https://infamous-freight-api.fly.dev/health`
3. Verify API responds with status 200
4. Test database connection
5. Verify Vercel web deployment status
6. Test API integration from web frontend
