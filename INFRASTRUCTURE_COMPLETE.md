## Current Architecture

### CI/CD Pipeline (6 Workflows)
```
On Every Push/PR:
├─ security-audit      → npm audit, Dependabot review
├─ lint-build         → ESLint, compile TypeScript
├─ test-coverage      → Jest unit/integration tests
├─ smoke-tests        → API health checks
├─ e2e-tests          → 21 Playwright tests (3 browsers)
└─ container-security → Trivy CVE scanning, SBOM generation
```

### Middleware Stack (API)
```
Request Flow:
1. Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
2. Rate limiting (per-endpoint presets)
3. Authentication/authorization
4. Business logic
5. Error handling → Sentry capture
6. CSP violation reporting
```

### Testing Matrix
```
E2E Tests: 21 cases × 3 browsers = 63 test executions per run
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop)
- Pixel 5, iPhone 12 (mobile)
- All critical user flows covered
```

### Container Scanning
```
Daily Scans:
- API Dockerfile (Node.js + npm packages)
- Web Dockerfile (Node.js + Next.js packages)
- Trivy vulnerability database (latest CVEs)
- SBOM generation (compliance tracking)
```

## Usage Guide

### Running E2E Tests Locally
```bash
# Interactive UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Headless mode
npx playwright test

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test e2e/tests/auth.spec.js --debug

# View report
npx playwright show-report
```

### Handling Vulnerabilities
```bash
# If Trivy finds CRITICAL/HIGH:
1. Check GitHub Security tab → Code scanning
2. Click CVE to view details
3. Run: npm update [vulnerable-package]
4. Verify: npm audit
5. Commit & push to re-run scans
```

### Monitoring Health
```bash
# Daily (5 min)
- Check API health endpoint
- Review error logs (Sentry dashboard)
- Monitor Codecov coverage trends

# Weekly (2 hr)
- Review E2E test results
- Check container scan SBOM
- Update outdated packages

# Monthly (4 hr)
- Full code audit
- Database maintenance
- Backup verification
```
