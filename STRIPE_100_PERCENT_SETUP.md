## 🔒 Webhook Events (Automatic Revenue Settlement)

All webhook events are configured to automatically update your database:

**Events Handled:**

1. **`payment_intent.succeeded`** - Payment successful
   - Updates database: `status = 'succeeded'`
   - Revenue: **100% to your Stripe account**

2. **`payment_intent.payment_failed`** - Payment failed
   - Updates database: `status = 'failed'`
   - Automatic retry eligible

3. **`customer.subscription.updated`** - Subscription renewed
   - Updates subscription status
   - Revenue: **100% to your Stripe account**

4. **`customer.subscription.deleted`** - Subscription cancelled
   - Updates database: `status = 'cancelled'`
   - Refund goes to customer, your balance remains

5. **`charge.refunded`** - Refund processed
   - Logged automatically
   - Customer receives full refund
   - Your original revenue remains in account

---

## 💰 Revenue Model - 100% to You

### Payment Flow

```
Customer Pays
    ↓
Stripe Processor Fee (2.9% + $0.30)
    ↓
Your Stripe Account (100% net after fees)
    ↓
Settlement (Daily or Weekly)
    ↓
Your Bank Account
```

**No additional fees.** All revenue after Stripe's payment processing fees goes directly to you.

### Example Transaction

Customer pays: **$100**
- Stripe fee: **$2.90** (2.9% + $0.30 standard rate)
- You receive: **$97.10** (100% of remainder)

### Monthly Calculations

Example with 50 customers:

- Total payments: **$5,000**
- Stripe fees: ~**$145** (2.9%)
- Your revenue: **$4,855** ✅ (100%)

---

## 📊 Dashboard Metrics

Access real-time revenue data:

```javascript
// Get revenue statistics
const response = await fetch('/api/billing/revenue', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

const { revenue } = await response.json();

console.log(`
  Last 30 Days:
  - One-time: $${revenue.totalOneTime}
  - Transactions: ${revenue.totalTransactions}
  - Active Subscriptions: ${revenue.activeSubscriptions}
  - Currency: ${revenue.currency}
`);
```

---

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Option 1: Stripe Connect (Multi-Merchant)

If you want to support multiple merchants:

```javascript
// Set in .env
STRIPE_CONNECT_ACCOUNT_ID=acct_1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H

// All payments route to connected account
// With automatic settlement
```

### Option 2: Custom Application Fee (Not Recommended)

To take a percentage:

```javascript
// In billing.js - NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED
// But if you wanted to take 20% and give 80%:

const applicationFee = Math.round(amountInCents * 0.20);

await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: amountInCents,
  application_fee_amount: applicationFee, // You get this
  // Rest goes to connected account
});
```

### Option 3: Custom Pricing

Adjust Stripe's standard rates:

1. Go to **Settings → Pricing**
2. Create custom pricing agreements
3. May require enterprise account

- Stripe handles all card data
- Only store Stripe payment intent IDs

⚠️ **Currency & Tax**
- Default currency: USD
- Tax calculation: Automatic (enabled)
- Support multiple currencies: ✅
