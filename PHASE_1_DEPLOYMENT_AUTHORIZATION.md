## 🚀 Deployment Execution Plan

### Deployment Steps (Approved Sequence)

**Step 1: Pre-Deployment Backup** (5 min)

```bash
mkdir -p backups
# Backup will be created before service startup
# Command: pg_dump -h postgres -U infamous -d infamous_freight > backups/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

**Step 2: Start Services** (5 min)

```bash
cd /workspaces/Infamous-freight-enterprises
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

**Step 3: Verify Services** (10 min)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
# All 7 services should show "Up"
```

**Step 4: Health Checks** (10 min)

```bash
# API Health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Web Load
curl http://localhost:3000

# Grafana Dashboard
curl http://localhost:3002
```

**Step 5: Smoke Tests** (10 min)

- Test AI endpoints
- Test voice endpoints (if enabled)
- Test API CRUD operations
- Test authentication flows

**Step 6: 24-Hour Monitoring** (Ongoing)
