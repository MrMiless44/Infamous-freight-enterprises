## Deployment Execution

### Pre-Deploy

- [ ] Team notified in communication channel (Slack/Discord)
- [ ] Deployment window scheduled (prefer off-peak hours)
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared and documented
- [ ] On-call engineer identified

### Deploy Steps

- [ ] **API Deployment:**
  - [ ] Trigger Render deployment (auto on push or manual)
  - [ ] Monitor build logs for errors
  - [ ] Wait for health check to pass
  - [ ] Verify `/api/health` endpoint returns 200

- [ ] **Web Deployment:**
  - [ ] Trigger Vercel deployment (auto on push or manual)
  - [ ] Monitor build logs for errors
  - [ ] Wait for deployment URL
  - [ ] Verify homepage loads without errors

- [ ] **Database Migrations:**
  - [ ] Run migrations on production database
  - [ ] Verify migration success in logs
  - [ ] Confirm schema changes applied

### Post-Deploy Verification

- [ ] Health checks passing (API + Web)
  - [ ] API: `curl https://api.infamous-freight.com/api/health`
  - [ ] Web: `curl https://infamous-freight.vercel.app`
- [ ] Critical user flows tested:
  - [ ] User authentication works
  - [ ] Dashboard loads
  - [ ] API endpoints responding
  - [ ] Database queries executing
- [ ] Error logs reviewed (no critical errors in last 10 minutes)
- [ ] Performance metrics within targets
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards checked:
  - [ ] Vercel Analytics (Web)
  - [ ] Render Dashboard (API)
  - [ ] Sentry (Error tracking)
  - [ ] Datadog RUM (if configured)

---

## Post-Deployment

### Immediate (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Monitor error rates (should be < 1%)
- [ ] Check API response times (should be < 1s P95)
- [ ] Verify no spike in error logs
- [ ] Confirm deployment status in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Team notified of successful deployment

### Short-Term (15-60 minutes)

- [ ] Monitor user sessions (no unusual drop-offs)
- [ ] Check performance metrics (no degradation)
- [ ] Review customer support channels (no new issues)
- [ ] Verify scheduled jobs/cron tasks running

### Medium-Term (1-24 hours)

- [ ] Daily metrics reviewed (compared to baseline)
- [ ] No critical bugs reported
- [ ] Performance stable
- [ ] Database query performance acceptable
- [ ] Cost metrics within budget

---

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

### Trigger Rollback If:

- Critical bugs affecting > 10% of users
- API error rate > 5%
- Database migration failures
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance degradation > 50%

### Rollback Steps:

1. [ ] **Immediate:** Stop new deployments (cancel in-progress builds)
2. [ ] **Revert Code:**
   - [ ] Revert git commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`
   - [ ] Push to main: `git push origin main`
   - [ ] Wait for auto-deployment or trigger manually
3. [ ] **Database Rollback:**
   - [ ] Run migration rollback if schema changed
   - [ ] Restore database backup if necessary (last resort)
4. [ ] **Verify Rollback:**
   - [ ] Health checks passing
   - [ ] Error rates back to normal
   - [ ] User flows working
5. [ ] **Post-Mortem:**
   - [ ] Document what went wrong
   - [ ] Identify root cause
   - [ ] Create action items to prevent recurrence
   - [ ] Update this checklist if needed
