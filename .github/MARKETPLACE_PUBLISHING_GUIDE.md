# Publishing Custom Actions to GitHub Marketplace

This guide explains how to publish the custom actions to the GitHub Marketplace.

## Actions Available for Publishing

1. **Health Check with Retries** (`.github/actions/health-check/`)
2. **Performance Regression Detection** (`.github/actions/performance-baseline/`)

---

## Prerequisites

- Repository must be **public** to publish to Marketplace
- Actions must be in the root of the repository or in subdirectories
- Each action needs:
  - `action.yml` (or `action.yaml`) file
  - `README.md` with documentation
  - Proper branding (icon and color)

---

## Publishing Steps

### Option 1: Publish from This Repository

**If you want to keep actions in this monorepo:**

1. **Create a Release Tag for Each Action**

```bash
# For health-check action v1.0.0
git tag -a health-check-v1.0.0 -m "Release health-check action v1.0.0"
git push origin health-check-v1.0.0

# For performance-baseline action v1.0.0
git tag -a performance-baseline-v1.0.0 -m "Release performance-baseline action v1.0.0"
git push origin performance-baseline-v1.0.0
```

2. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Go to https://github.com/MrMiless44/Infamous-freight-enterprises/releases/new
   - Select the tag you just created
   - Add release notes
   - Check "Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace"
   - Select primary category (e.g., "Deployment", "Continuous integration")
   - Add secondary categories if applicable
   - Publish release

3. **Users Can Reference Your Actions**

```yaml
# From your repository
- uses: MrMiless44/Infamous-freight-enterprises/.github/actions/health-check@v1.0.0
  with:
    url: https://api.example.com/health
```

---

### Option 2: Publish as Separate Repositories (Recommended)

**For cleaner marketplace presence and easier discovery:**

#### Health Check Action

1. **Create New Repository:** `health-check-action`
2. **Copy Files:**
   ```bash
   # In the new repository
   cp action.yml .
   cp README.md .
   ```
3. **Update README.md usage example:**
   ```yaml
   - uses: MrMiless44/health-check-action@v1
     with:
       url: https://api.example.com/health
   ```
4. **Commit and Tag:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial release"
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin main
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
5. **Create Release with Marketplace Publishing**

#### Performance Baseline Action

1. **Create New Repository:** `performance-baseline-action`
2. **Copy Files:**
   ```bash
   # In the new repository
   cp action.yml .
   cp ../performance-baselines.json ./example-baselines.json
   ```
3. **Create README.md** with usage examples
4. **Commit and Tag:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial release"
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin main
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
5. **Create Release with Marketplace Publishing**

## Versioning Strategy

Use **Semantic Versioning** (semver):

- **Major (v2.0.0):** Breaking changes to inputs/outputs
- **Minor (v1.1.0):** New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (v1.0.1):** Bug fixes, backward compatible

**Create Major Version Tags:**

```bash
# After releasing v1.0.0, create v1 tag
git tag -fa v1 -m "Update v1 to v1.0.0"
git push origin v1 --force

# Users can reference with @v1 (auto-updates to latest v1.x.x)
- uses: MrMiless44/health-check-action@v1
```
