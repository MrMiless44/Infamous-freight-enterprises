Execution Guidelines

- Track progress via this checklist and record a short summary for each completed step.
- Keep responses concise; summarize command output and avoid unnecessary structure explanations.
- Use the workspace root for shell commands unless the user specifies another directory.
- Avoid adding media or links unless asked; mark placeholders clearly if they must be used.
- Follow all project setup rules and never revert user changes without direction.
- Install only extensions explicitly requested by the user or setup instructions.
- Default to minimal starter projects if future requirements are unclear and ask for clarification when needed.
- Create new folders only when required for the task (besides `.vscode` for tasks).
- Ensure generated components directly support the requested workflow; confirm assumptions before implementing extra features.
- Completion criteria: project scaffolding and compilation succeed, README remains current, and this instruction file accurately reflects project status.

- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
