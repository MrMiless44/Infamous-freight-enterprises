# Task 3: Rate Limiting Tuning
# Current limits (from .env.production):
#   - General: 100/15min → Adjust to 150/15min
#   - Auth: 5/15min → Keep same (security)
#   - AI: 20/1min → Adjust to 30/1min
#   - Billing: 30/15min → Keep same

# Task 4: API Response Optimization
# Implement pagination:

#   - Database queries: Average 150ms

# After optimization (targets):
#   - Response time p95: < 1.5s (-25%)
#   - Error rate: < 0.3%
#   - Database queries: Average < 100ms

# 5. Verify no regressions
# Check:
#   - All tests still pass
