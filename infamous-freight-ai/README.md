# Infæmous Freight ♊ – AI Synthetic Intelligence Stack

This repo contains a minimal but complete stack:

- `api`: Node.js Express + Prisma API with AI Synthetic client
- `web`: Next.js web UI with AI avatars
- `postgres`: PostgreSQL via Docker
- `nginx`: Reverse proxy routing `/` to web and `/api` to API
- `docker-compose.yml`: Single-command local deployment

## Quick start (local)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

- Web: <http://localhost>
- API health: <http://localhost/api/health>

## Database

The API uses Prisma with Postgres.

Inside the api container:

```bash
docker compose run api npm run prisma:generate
docker compose run api npm run prisma:migrate:dev
docker compose run api npm run seed
```

`npm run prisma:migrate` (without `:dev`) is ready for production deploy pipelines.

## Payments

- `POST /api/payments/intent` creates a Stripe Payment Intent (amount in cents).
- `POST /api/payments/paypal/order` provisions a PayPal order and returns the approval links.
- `POST /api/payments/paypal/:orderId/capture` finalizes PayPal orders after approval.
- Webhook receivers live at `/api/payments/webhook/stripe` and `/api/payments/webhook/paypal`.

Set the Stripe and PayPal environment variables in `.env` (or your secret manager) before using these routes.

## Notes

- Do not commit real secrets.
- Configure CI secrets in GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

## How to deploy this

1. Create a new GitHub repo (private).
2. Copy all these files into that repo with the same structure.
3. Commit and push.
4. On your machine, from repo root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

You now have a running Infæmous Freight ♊ stack: API + Web + AI simulator behind a single compose file, ready to grow with more AI SYNTHETIC INTELLIGENCE features.

If you want, next we can add Prisma migrations for the DB, Stripe/PayPal billing routes, or a voice/command endpoint where you “call” your avatar by name and it responds.
