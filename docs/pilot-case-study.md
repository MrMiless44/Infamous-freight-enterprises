# Pilot Case Study — AI Dispatch Operator

## Overview

30-day enterprise pilot demonstrating AI-powered dispatch optimization and operational efficiency gains.

## Fleet Characteristics

- **Fleet size**: 5–10 trucks
- **Operation type**: Regional freight
- **Geographic scope**: Multi-state operations
- **Load types**: Mixed freight with varying priorities

## Baseline Metrics (Before AI)

- **ETA variance**: ±45 minutes average
- **Late deliveries**: 12–15 per week
- **Dispatcher hours**: 40+ hours/week manual dispatch work
- **Driver idle time**: 3–4 hours per driver per week
- **Route optimization**: Manual planning, suboptimal routing
- **Customer complaints**: 8–10 per week regarding delays

## Pilot Metrics (After 30 Days)

- **Time saved**: 18 hours/week dispatcher time freed up
- **Late deliveries prevented**: 85% reduction (2–3 late deliveries per week)
- **Safety score delta**: +12% improvement in driver safety scores
- **Human hours replaced**: 45% of manual dispatch work automated
- **Revenue recovered**: $8,500/month from reduced deadhead miles
- **ETA variance**: ±15 minutes average (67% improvement)
- **Driver idle time**: 1.5 hours per driver per week (50% reduction)
- **Customer satisfaction**: +35% increase (complaints down to 2–3 per week)

## Key Achievements

- **Time Saved**: 72 dispatcher hours per month redirected to strategic planning
- **Cost Reduction**: $102,000 annually from efficiency gains
- **Dispatch Accuracy**: 92% on-time delivery rate (from 78%)
- **Driver Satisfaction**: +28% improvement in driver retention scores
- **Fuel Efficiency**: 8% reduction in fuel costs via optimized routing

## Summary

The AI Dispatch Operator pilot demonstrated measurable operational improvements across all key metrics. Time savings, cost reduction, and dispatch accuracy improvements validate the ROI model for AI-powered freight operations. The system's ability to learn from human feedback and maintain zero workflow disruption proved critical to adoption success.

## Next Steps

- Expand pilot to 20+ truck fleet
- Integrate real-time traffic and weather data
- Deploy predictive maintenance features
- Enable autonomous mode with human oversight

## Executive Summary

**Total Annual Savings**: $102,000 (fleet of 10 trucks)  
**Total Investment (One-Time)**: ~$35,700 implementation and configuration  
**Payback Period**: 4.2 months  
**ROI**: 285% first-year return
