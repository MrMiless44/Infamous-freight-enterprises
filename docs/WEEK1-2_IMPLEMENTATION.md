## 1. CODEOWNERS File (`/.github/CODEOWNERS`)

### What It Does

Automatically assigns pull requests to code owners based on file paths. GitHub enforces that changes must be reviewed by owners.

### Files Created

- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - 45 lines, covers all major directories

### How It Works

When a PR touches API files, GitHub automatically requests reviews from `@MrMiless44`. Configure additional team members as your team grows.

### Usage

```bash
# Add team members as codebase grows
# Edit .github/CODEOWNERS

* @MrMiless44
/api/ @MrMiless44 @backend-team
/web/ @MrMiless44 @frontend-team
```

### Benefits

✅ Ensures experienced reviewers check code  
✅ Prevents unauthorized changes to critical files  
✅ Documents code ownership  
✅ Reduces context switching

---

## 2. Sentry Error Tracking (`/api/src/config/sentry.js`)

### What It Does

Captures all unhandled errors in production and sends them to Sentry.io dashboard with context, stack traces, and user information.

### Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/config/sentry.js` - 83 lines (Sentry initialization & helpers)
- `api/src/server.js` - Updated to initialize Sentry early
- `api/package.json` - Added `@sentry/node` dependency

### Setup Requirements

**Step 1: Create Sentry Account**

```
1. Visit https://sentry.io
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create project "Infamous-freight-api"
4. Note your DSN: https://xxx@xxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxx
```

**Step 2: Add Environment Variable**

```bash
# In your production environment (.env or deployment platform)
SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@xxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxx
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Step 3: Optional - Setup Alerts**

```
In Sentry dashboard:
1. Settings → Alerts → Create Alert Rule
2. Trigger: Error rate > 1%
3. Action: Send to Slack #alerts
4. Save
```

### How It Works

```
User makes request → Error occurs →
  Sentry captures error with:
    - Stack trace
    - Request data (user, IP, path)
    - Environment (api version, Node version)
    - Browser/Device info
  → Sends to Sentry.io →
  Dashboard shows aggregated errors with trends
```

### Use in Code

```javascript
// Automatic capturing (middleware handles this)
// No changes needed to existing code

// Manual capturing for specific flows
const { captureException, captureMessage } = require("./config/sentry");

try {
  await processPayment(order);
} catch (error) {
  captureException(error, { orderId: order.id });
  // Error is now in Sentry dashboard
}
```

### Monitoring

```
Daily check:
1. Visit Sentry dashboard
2. Filter by Critical/Fatal
3. If > 5 critical errors, investigate
4. Review error trends
```

### Benefits

✅ Real-time error notifications  
✅ Stack traces & full context  
✅ User impact analysis  
✅ Regression detection  
✅ Historical error trends

---

## 3. Rate Limiting (`/api/src/middleware/security.js`)

### What It Does

Prevents API abuse by limiting requests from each IP address. Protects against:

- Brute force attacks (login attempts)
- DDoS attacks (volumetric)
- Scraping (data harvesting)
- Resource exhaustion

### Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/middleware/security.js` - Enhanced with express-rate-limit
- `api/src/routes/ai.commands.js` - Applied AI rate limiter (example)
- `api/package.json` - Added `express-rate-limit` dependency

### Configuration

**Default Limits** (adjust via environment variables):

```javascript
// General API endpoints
general: 100 requests per 15 minutes (≈ 0.1 req/sec)

// Authentication (strict)
auth: 5 requests per 15 minutes (≈ 0.005 req/sec)

// Billing (moderate)
billing: 30 requests per 15 minutes (≈ 0.03 req/sec)

// AI endpoints (restrictive)
ai: 20 requests per minute (≈ 0.3 req/sec)
```

### Usage

**Apply to routes:**

```javascript
const { limiters } = require('../middleware/security');

// Login endpoint (strict limiting)
router.post('/login', limiters.auth, authenticate, ...);

// AI endpoint (AI-specific limiting)
router.post('/ai/command', limiters.ai, ...);

// Payment (billing limiting)
router.post('/billing/charge', limiters.billing, ...);
```

**Customize limits:**

```javascript
const { createLimiter } = require("../middleware/security");

const customLimiter = createLimiter({
  windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute window
  max: 10, // 10 requests max
  message: "Custom message",
});

router.post("/custom-endpoint", customLimiter, handler);
```

### Response When Limited

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit. Please try again later.",
  "retryAfter": 900 // Seconds until limit resets
}
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Override default limits (optional)
RATE_LIMIT_POINTS=100        # Points per limit
RATE_LIMIT_DURATION=60       # Duration in seconds
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check rate limit headers in API responses
curl -I https://api.infamous-freight.com/api/health

# Look for:
# RateLimit-Limit: 100
# RateLimit-Remaining: 99
# RateLimit-Reset: 1702392000
```

### Benefits

✅ Prevents brute force attacks  
✅ Reduces server load from abuse  
✅ Protects billing endpoints specifically  
✅ Prevents data scraping  
✅ Enables fair usage enforcement

## 4. Database Migration Strategy (`/docs/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md`)

### What It Does

Documents safe, reversible procedures for all database schema changes. Ensures migrations are:

- Tested locally first
- Reversible (rollback available)
- Zero-downtime where possible
- Backed up before execution
- Verified after completion

### File Created

- `docs/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md` - 450+ lines, comprehensive guide

### Key Procedures

**Development (Local Testing)**

```bash
# Create migration based on schema.prisma changes
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_user_roles

# This creates SQL file and applies to local DB
# Then commit to git
git add prisma/migrations/
git commit -m "chore(db): add user roles"
```

**Production (Safe Deployment)**

```bash
# 1. Backup database (CRITICAL)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_20241213.sql

# 2. Test migration locally first
npx prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature

# 3. Execute in production
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Verify success
npx prisma migrate status
curl http://api/health  # Verify API still works
```

**Rollback (If Issues)**

```bash
# Option 1: Create inverse migration (preferred)
npx prisma migrate dev --name rollback_user_roles

# Option 2: Restore from backup
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup_20241213.sql
```

### Safe vs. Dangerous Migrations

**Safe (No data loss):**
✅ Adding nullable columns  
✅ Adding new tables  
✅ Renaming columns

**Dangerous (Requires strategy):**
⚠️ Removing columns  
⚠️ Changing column types  
⚠️ Adding NOT NULL columns

**Critical (Requires approval):**
❌ Dropping tables with data  
❌ Major schema restructuring

### Pre-Flight Checks

Before every production migration:

```bash
□ Database backed up
□ Migration tested locally
□ No active connections
□ Health checks ready
□ Rollback plan documented
□ Team notified
```

### Benefits

✅ Prevents data loss  
✅ Enables rollbacks  
✅ Reduces deployment risk  
✅ Documents schema changes  
✅ Provides safety procedures
