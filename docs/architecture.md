# System Architecture

Infæmous Freight Enterprise is a multi-tenant AI-first logistics operating system.

Core layers:

- API (Express + Prisma)
- AI Synthetic Intelligence ♊️ orchestration
- Web dashboard (Next.js)
- Mobile application (React Native)
- Shared domain packages

AI agents are first-class system actors, with the UI remaining as a thin, stateless shell. All intelligence, validation, and state transitions run server-side for observability, auditability, and resilience.

## Layered Architecture

Client (Web / Mobile) → API Gateway → AI Orchestration → Business Logic Engine → Data + Memory Layer → Automation + Jobs

## Architecture Freeze Policy

To stop structural churn, the architecture is frozen and changes to core boundaries require an ADR and approval. See [ADR-0007: Architecture Freeze and Change Control](adr/0007-architecture-freeze.md) for the decision, scope, and allowed changes.

### Core Responsibilities

- **API Gateway**: Authentication, rate limiting, request normalization, and routing to orchestrated skills.
- **AI Orchestration Layer**: Prompt router, skill selection, memory injection, model routing, validation, and fallback reasoning.
- **Business Logic Engine**: Domain services for billing, invoice intelligence, ERP/TMS integrations, compliance, and workflow state machines.
- **Data + Memory Layer**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for embeddings, optional vector index, Redis for cache/session, and durable audit/event streams.
- **Automation + Jobs**: BullMQ/Temporal-backed schedulers for learning loops, monitoring, alerts, and auto-optimization tasks.

## Frontend (Web + Mobile)

- **Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, server actions, auth middleware; React Native for mobile.
- **Modules**: Dashboard, AI avatar interface, task/workflow viewer, billing, settings, memory/history view.
- **Principles**: Stateless UI, realtime updates via WebSockets, avatar as presentation only (no client-side logic), feature flags for rollout.

## AI Synthetic Intelligence Layer

- **Components**: Prompt router, skill modules, memory engine, decision scorer, fallback reasoner.
- **Flow**: User intent → classifier → skill match → memory injection → LLM execution (OpenAI primary, Anthropic secondary, heuristic fallback) → validation → action/response.
- **Safety**: Deterministic validation, tool-use approvals, audit trails per decision, and consistent persona (“persistent AI operator”).

## Avatar System

- **State**: Avatar profile + personality matrix + visual state engine + interaction history.
- **Capabilities**: Learns user behavior, adapts tone, surfaces proactive recommendations, represents AI as a human-like operator backed by memory.

## Memory Engine

- **Types**: Short-term (session), long-term (user), task memory, preference memory.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (structured), JSONB for embeddings, optional vector index, Redis for fast session/cache.
- **Rules**: Always retrieve before responding, avoid hallucination, decay unused memory, promote frequently used memory, include retrieval traces in audit logs.

## Backend API

- **Stack**: Node.js 20, Express/Fastify, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Redis.
- **Services**: Auth, AI execution, avatar state, billing, automation, webhooks, ERP/TMS connectors, invoice intelligence.
- **Security**: JWT + refresh, rate limiting, encrypted secrets, audit logs, SOC2-lite controls.

## Automation Engine

- **Jobs**: Scheduled AI tasks, monitoring, alerts, auto-optimizations, daily system learning, data hygiene.
- **Tools**: BullMQ/Temporal with cron fallbacks and idempotent job handlers.

## Billing & Access Control

- **Billing**: Stripe subscriptions + usage metering, AI-call metering, plan-based entitlements.
- **Access**: RBAC with scopes, feature flags per role/plan, webhook signing for external callbacks.

## Deployment & CI/CD

- **Infrastructure**: Docker for all services; Render/Fly.io for API, Vercel for frontend; Supabase/RDS for PostgreSQL.
- **Pipelines**: GitHub Actions with lint/type-check/test gates, build artifacts, deployment promotion with rollbacks, environment secrets via secure stores.
- **Observability**: Structured logging, request IDs, distributed tracing, SLO dashboards, alerting hooks into monitoring tools.
