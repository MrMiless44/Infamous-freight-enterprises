# Test Coverage Gaps

## Overview

Current test coverage: **84.31%** (184/197 tests passing)

This document explains what is NOT covered by tests and why.

## Intentionally Excluded from Testing

### 1. Database Connection Errors (prisma.js - 54.54%)

**Lines not covered**: 14, 18-19, 23-24

**Why**: These lines handle catastrophic database connection failures:

```javascript
// Line 14: Connection failure
catch (e) {
  console.error("Failed to connect to database:", e);
}

// Lines 18-19, 23-24: Graceful shutdown on process signals
process.on("SIGINT", disconnect);
process.on("SIGTERM", disconnect);
```

**Reason**: Testing requires:

- Simulating database crashes
- Mocking process signal handlers
- Complex test environment setup

**Risk level**: LOW - These are defensive fallbacks that rarely execute in production.

### 2. Process Signal Handlers (server.js - 90%)

**Lines not covered**: 56-57, 92, 106-107

**Why**: SIGINT and SIGTERM signal handling for graceful shutdown:

```javascript
process.on("SIGINT", shutdown);
process.on("SIGTERM", shutdown);
```

**Reason**:

- Requires process.kill() simulation
- Jest doesn't handle process signals well
- Integration tests better suited

**Risk level**: LOW - Standard Node.js patterns, well-tested in production.

### 3. AI Service Retry Logic (aiSyntheticClient.js - 68.35%)

**Lines not covered**: 62-63, 77-85, 140-174

**Why**: Complex retry mechanisms and streaming error scenarios:

- Exponential backoff calculations
- Network timeout simulations
- Stream interruption handling

**Reason**:

- Requires flaky network simulation
- Time-dependent test cases
- Better covered by integration/load tests

**Risk level**: MEDIUM - Tested manually, but automated coverage gaps remain.

### 4. User Deletion Error Paths (users.js - 76.36%)

**Lines not covered**: 66, 103-108, 145, 167, 179-197

**Why**: Database constraint violations and edge cases:

```javascript
// User not found scenarios
// Foreign key constraint errors
// Transaction rollback failures
```

**Reason**:

- Requires database state manipulation
- Complex Prisma mock scenarios
- Low probability events

**Risk level**: LOW - Covered by manual QA testing.

### 5. Voice File Processing Errors (voice.js - 82.35%)

**Lines not covered**: 41-43, 62, 80

**Why**: File upload edge cases:

- Corrupted audio files
- OpenAI Whisper API failures
- File system errors

**Reason**:

- External API dependency
- File I/O complexity
- Better suited for integration tests

**Risk level**: MEDIUM - Errors are handled but not unit tested.

## Testing Strategy

### What We Test Well (≥90% coverage)

✅ **Middleware** (92.5%):

- Authentication & authorization
- Rate limiting
- Validation
- Error handling
- Security headers

✅ **Configuration** (100%):

- Environment validation
- Sentry integration

✅ **Core Routes** (81.98% average):

- Shipments CRUD
- Users CRUD
- AI commands
- Health checks

### What We Test Adequately (75-90%)

⚠️ **Business Logic** (81-87%):

- Billing integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- Voice commands
- AI synthetic client

### What Could Be Improved (<75%)

❌ **Infrastructure** (54-71%):

- Database connection handling
- Process lifecycle management
- Stream processing

## Recommended Approach

### Instead of Chasing 100% Unit Test Coverage:

**1. Integration Tests** (High Value)

```javascript
// tests/integration/shipment-workflow.test.js
test("complete shipment lifecycle", async () => {
  // Create → Update → Track → Deliver
  // Tests real DB, real API, real flows
});
```

**2. Load Testing** (Production Confidence)

```javascript
// tests/load/api-endpoints.js
import http from "k6/http";
// Verify API handles production load
```

**3. Manual QA** (Edge Cases)

- Test disaster recovery scenarios
- Verify graceful degradation
- Check error monitoring (Sentry)

## Coverage Thresholds

Current enforcement (jest.config.js):

```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 75,    // Current: 77%
    functions: 80,   // Current: 81.25%
    lines: 84,       // Current: 85.54%
    statements: 84,  // Current: 84.31%
  },
}
```

**Philosophy**: Maintain 84%+ coverage for business logic, accept gaps in defensive/infrastructure code.

## When to Add Tests

✅ **Always test**:

- New business logic
- Bug fixes (regression tests)
- Critical path code
- Public API endpoints

❌ **Skip testing**:

- Process signal handlers
- One-time setup code
- Third-party library wrappers
- Defensive error handlers

## Monitoring in Production

Instead of 100% unit test coverage, we rely on:

1. **Sentry Error Tracking**: Catches all production errors
2. **Health Checks**: `/api/health` monitors system status
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protects against abuse
4. **Audit Logs**: Tracks all critical operations
5. **CI/CD**: Enforces 84%+ coverage threshold
