## Guardrails and Safety Mechanisms

### Data Access Controls

**Tier 1 - Read Only (All AI Roles):**

- Operational shipment data
- Public route and traffic information
- Historical performance metrics (aggregated)

**Tier 2 - Restricted Read (Authorized AI Roles):**

- Individual driver performance metrics (Driver Coach AI only)
- Vehicle health telemetry (Fleet Intelligence AI only)
- Customer communication history (Customer Ops AI only)
- Dispatch assignments and schedules (Dispatch Operator AI only)

**Tier 3 - Prohibited (All AI Roles):**

- Financial transaction details
- Driver personal identifiable information (PII)
- Employee compensation records
- Contract negotiation details
- Legal documents and compliance filings

### Escalation Procedures

**Automatic Escalation Triggers:**

1. **Low Confidence**: AI decision confidence below role-specific threshold
2. **Policy Violation**: Attempted action outside defined boundaries
3. **High Financial Impact**: Decisions with financial impact >$1,000
4. **Safety Critical**: Any action that could impact driver or public safety
5. **Regulatory Concern**: Actions that may have compliance implications
6. **Customer Dispute**: Customer challenges AI-generated response
7. **Data Anomaly**: Unexpected data patterns that may indicate errors

**Escalation Workflow:**

```
AI Decision → Confidence Check → [Below Threshold] → Human Review Queue
                ↓
          [Above Threshold]
                ↓
          Guardrail Check → [Violation] → Block + Alert + Human Review
                ↓
          [Passes Guardrails]
                ↓
          Execute Action → Log Decision → Audit Trail
```

**Human Review SLA:**

- Critical safety issues: Immediate (< 15 minutes)
- Financial decisions: 1 hour
- Customer disputes: 2 hours
- Routine escalations: 4 hours

### Audit and Compliance

**Decision Logging Requirements:**

Every AI decision must log:

- Timestamp and unique decision ID
- AI role that made the decision
- Input data and context used
- Confidence score
- Action taken or recommended
- Rationale/reasoning (if available from model)
- Human approval status (if required)
- Outcome and any post-action corrections

**Audit Trail Retention:**

- Operational decisions: 7 years (regulatory requirement)
- Safety-related decisions: Permanent
- Financial decisions: 7 years
- Customer interactions: 3 years

**Regular Audit Schedule:**

- Daily: Automated anomaly detection on AI decisions
- Weekly: Sample review of high-confidence auto-executed actions
- Monthly: Comprehensive review of escalated decisions
- Quarterly: External audit of AI decision quality and boundaries compliance

## Override and Correction Procedures

### Human Override Rights

**Any human operator can:**

- Override any AI decision in real-time
- Block AI actions before execution
- Modify AI recommendations
- Escalate decisions for additional review
- Report AI errors or boundary violations

**Override Process:**

1. Human identifies issue with AI decision
2. Human accesses override interface
3. Provides reason for override
4. System logs override event with reasoning
5. AI model is flagged for review if pattern emerges
6. Post-action review determines if model retraining needed

### Post-Action Corrections

**If AI decision was incorrect:**

1. Identify the error and impact
2. Correct the operational impact (e.g., re-route shipment, update customer)
3. Log correction with root cause analysis
4. Flag for model review and potential retraining
5. Update guardrails if systematic issue detected
6. Notify affected parties of correction

## Training and Model Updates

**Model Retraining Triggers:**

- Override rate exceeds 10% for any AI role
- Pattern of boundary violations detected
- Significant changes in operational processes
- Introduction of new regulations or compliance requirements
- Quarterly scheduled retraining with new data

**Testing Before Deployment:**

- Shadow mode testing (AI suggestions shown but not executed)
- A/B testing with control group
- Gradual rollout with confidence threshold adjustment
- Human review of first 100 decisions
- Full deployment only after passing quality metrics

## Incident Response

**AI Boundary Violation Protocol:**

1. **Detect**: Automated monitoring or human report
2. **Isolate**: Immediately suspend AI role if safety-critical
3. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact of violation
4. **Correct**: Fix operational impact and prevent recurrence
5. **Review**: Root cause analysis and process improvement
6. **Communicate**: Notify stakeholders and document lessons learned

**Incident Severity Levels:**

- **P0 (Critical)**: Safety impact, regulatory violation, data breach
  - Response time: Immediate
  - Escalation: CTO + Legal
  - AI suspension: Automatic
- **P1 (High)**: Financial impact >$10K, customer data exposure, repeated boundary violations
  - Response time: 1 hour
  - Escalation: Engineering manager + Operations lead
  - AI suspension: Review-based
- **P2 (Medium)**: Customer complaints, minor boundary violations, confidence drift
  - Response time: 4 hours
  - Escalation: Team lead
  - AI suspension: Not required

- **P3 (Low)**: Non-critical errors, minor quality issues
  - Response time: Next business day
  - Escalation: On-call engineer
  - AI suspension: Not required

## Stakeholder Communication
