## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Monorepo with pnpm

- Uses workspace protocol (`workspace:*`)
- Shared dependencies at root
- Service-specific dependencies in subdirectories
- Filtered commands: `pnpm --filter <package-name> <command>`

### Shared Package Usage

```typescript
// In any service
import { User, formatDate, HTTP_STATUS } from "@infamous-freight/shared";
```

---

## ✨ Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. **TypeScript Migration for API** - Convert API from JavaScript to TypeScript
2. **Shared UI Components** - Create `@infamous-freight/ui` package
3. **Storybook Integration** - Component documentation
4. **Docker Compose Update** - Optimize for monorepo
5. **GraphQL API** - Add GraphQL layer if needed

---

## 🤝 Contributing

With the new setup:

1. Branch from `main`
2. Make changes
3. Pre-commit hooks run automatically
4. Push and create PR
5. CI runs tests and coverage
6. Merge after approval

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Working with Shared Package

```bash
# After changing shared package
pnpm --filter @infamous-freight/shared build

# Then rebuild dependent services
pnpm --filter infamous-freight-api build
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Check workspace structure
pnpm list --depth=0

# Check dependencies
pnpm why <package-name>

# Update dependencies
pnpm update --interactive --latest
```

### Performance

```bash
# Clear pnpm cache
pnpm store prune

# Verify cache
pnpm store status
```
