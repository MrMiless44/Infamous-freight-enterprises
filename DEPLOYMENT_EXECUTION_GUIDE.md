## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 30 Minutes)

### 1️⃣ MARK TODO #1 IN PROGRESS

Mark "Complete Pre-Flight Checklist" as in-progress

### 2️⃣ COMPLETE 6 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**What**: Execute 6 mandatory steps before any deployment

**Where**: See [DEPLOYMENT_PRE-FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md](DEPLOYMENT_PRE-FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md) for full details

**Quick Checklist**:

```
[ ] Create .env.production file with all required variables
    DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET (32+ chars), REDIS_URL, CORS_ORIGINS, etc.

[ ] Create database backup
    Command: pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d infamous_freight > backup.sql

[ ] Run pre-deployment check
    Command: bash scripts/pre-deployment-check.sh
    Must pass ALL 14 checks ✅

[ ] Get stakeholder approvals
    Technical Lead, Product Manager, Operations Lead

[ ] Confirm on-call coverage
    Engineer available for 24-hour monitoring

[ ] Notify team
    Send deployment notification to Slack/email
```

### 3️⃣ RUN PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECK

```bash
# Execute verification
bash scripts/pre-deployment-check.sh

# Expected: 14/14 checks PASS ✅
# If ANY fail: STOP and troubleshoot
```

**Success**: All 14 checks show GREEN ✅

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE (45 Minutes Total)

### PHASE 1: Final Verification (5 min)

```bash
# Confirm all requirements met
cd /workspaces/Infamous-freight-enterprises
bash scripts/pre-deployment-check.sh

# If all pass → Continue
# If any fail → STOP and troubleshoot
```

---

### PHASE 2: Database Backup (3 min)

```bash
# Create timestamped backup
BACKUP_FILE="backup_pre-deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql"
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d infamous_freight > "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Verify backup
ls -lh "$BACKUP_FILE"  # Should be > 1KB
pg_restore --list "$BACKUP_FILE" | head

# Save location
echo "$BACKUP_FILE" > .backup-location
echo "✅ Backup ready: $BACKUP_FILE"
```

---

### PHASE 3: Deploy (10 min)

**OPTION A: Recommended (Automated Script)**

```bash
# Execute deployment script
bash scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Script will:
# ✅ Install dependencies
# ✅ Run tests
# ✅ Build TypeScript
# ✅ Run database migrations
# ✅ Run security audit
# ✅ Start services with PM2
```

**OPTION B: Docker Compose**

```bash
# Deploy using Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Monitor startup (Ctrl+C to exit)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f
```

---

### PHASE 4: Stabilization (5 min)

```bash
# Wait for services to start
sleep 30

# Verify all containers running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps

# Expected output: 7 services, all "Up"
```

---

### PHASE 5: Health Check (5 min)

```bash
# Test API health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Expected response (200 OK):
# {
#   "uptime": 45.123,
#   "timestamp": 1704067200000,
#   "status": "ok",
#   "database": "connected",
#   "redis": "connected"
# }
```

**If health check fails**:

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs api | tail -50

# Troubleshoot and STOP before proceeding
```

---

### PHASE 6: Smoke Tests (5 min)

```bash
# Test AI Dispatch (requires valid JWT token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/dispatch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"loadId": "test"}'

# Test AI Coaching
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/drivers/1/coaching \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Check Grafana Dashboard
# Open: http://localhost:3002
# Login: admin / [YOUR_GRAFANA_PASSWORD]
```

---

### PHASE 7: Monitoring Verification (5 min)

```bash
# Verify Prometheus metrics
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query='up'

# Check alert rules
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/rules

# Open Grafana dashboards
# http://localhost:3002 → API Dashboard

# Expected: 9 panels with live data
```

---

### PHASE 8: Begin 24h Monitoring (Continuous)

```bash
# Keep terminal open for log monitoring
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f api

# Open Grafana in browser
# http://localhost:3002

# Monitor these metrics every 5 minutes:
# - Error rate (target: < 0.1%)
# - Response time p95 (target: < 2s)
# - CPU usage (target: < 50%)
# - Memory usage (target: < 60%)
# - Active connections (target: > 0)
```

```bash
# STOP everything
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down

# Restore database
pg_restore --dbname=infamous_freight < $(cat .backup-location)

# Restart with backup state
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```
