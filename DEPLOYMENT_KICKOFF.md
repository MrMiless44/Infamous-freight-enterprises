---

## 🎯 Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Run comprehensive pre-deployment checks
bash scripts/pre-deployment-check.sh

# Expected: ALL 14 CHECKS PASS ✅
# If any fail: STOP and troubleshoot
```

### Phase 2: Environment Preparation (10 minutes)

**Requirements before proceeding:**

- [ ] `.env.production` file created with:
  - DATABASE_URL (valid PostgreSQL connection)
  - JWT_SECRET (32+ characters, stored securely)
  - REDIS_URL (Redis connection string)
  - CORS_ORIGINS (your domain)
  - GRAFANA_PASSWORD (admin password)
  - NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Secrets stored securely (NOT in git)
- [ ] Database backups created and tested
- [ ] On-call engineer standing by

### Phase 3: Database Backup (10 minutes)

```bash
# Create backup BEFORE deployment
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d infamous_freight > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup can be restored
# DO NOT proceed without verified backup
```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# OPTION 1: Automated Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
bash scripts/deploy-production.sh

# OPTION 2: Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Monitor deployment in real-time
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Phase 5: Post-Deployment Validation (15 minutes)

```bash
# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Test metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/metrics

# Test authentication
# (use actual JWT token)

# Test AI services
# POST /api/dispatch/assign
# GET /api/drivers/:id/coaching

# Verify no 500 errors
docker-compose logs api | grep -i error
```

### Phase 6: 24-Hour Monitoring (CONTINUOUS)

- Monitor Grafana: http://localhost:3002
- Watch error rates, response times, resource usage
- Log any issues for post-deployment optimization
- Have on-call engineer available

---

## ⚠️ GO/NO-GO Criteria

### GO Criteria (All must pass)

- ✅ Pre-deployment check: 14/14 pass
- ✅ Tests: 5/5 passing
- ✅ Build: 0 errors
- ✅ Database backup: Verified
- ✅ Security audit: Clean
- ✅ Health endpoints: Responding
- ✅ On-call coverage: Confirmed
- ✅ Rollback plan: Documented

### NO-GO Criteria (Any of these triggers rollback)

- ❌ Pre-deployment check fails
- ❌ Database backup fails
- ❌ Health endpoints not responding
- ❌ Error rate > 5%
- ❌ Critical services down
- ❌ No on-call coverage
- ❌ Stakeholder approval not obtained
